Get ready to solve the challenging Data Science problem using BigQuery and Colab.

For this Hackathon, you will be working on obfuscated and anonymized real-world data (~ 4.2 million records) from an e-commerce website to build a model that can predict customers' Long Term Value (LTV). This challenge has all the exciting elements of complex data engineering, preprocessing, model building, and different programming languages (SQL & Python) that simulate real-world problem-solving. The dataset is a public fork of the BigQuery Ga4 Public Datasets, customized for the hackathon.
